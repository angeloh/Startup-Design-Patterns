				<h3>
					What Are the Elements of A Successful
					Startup?
				</h3>
				That's a question I am obsessed with answering. Successful
				startups have common elements that can be identified, categorized and applied to any
				web business even though it may be doing something completely different.
                <br><br>
				What are the similarities between Facebook and Google?
				Between Groupon and Zynga? By identifying the commonalities
				between these great companies we can begin to find
				patterns, design patterns, that anyone can use
				to improve their ability to target and retain
				users and increase their chances of success.

				<h3>The First Open-Source Book</h3>
				As the book develops I will commit my progress regularly
				to GitHub. This means that anyone can
				edit, contribute to, or fork the book as it's
				being written, adding both to the quality of the book and
				helping to foster a new creative writing process.
                <br><br>    
				If you contribute to the book on GitHub 
				you will be listed as a contributor or editor, whichever is more appropirate,
				when it is finally published.

			<h3>What has been done so far?</h3>
			Some of the commonalities between successful startups like Google, Facebook, Zynga, Groupon and a few others have already been articulated. 
			From there, more startup examples will be brought into the project and initial research conducted. Second round research includes interviews with critical target start up players including the active particpants in the company and its financial partners. This will bring us closer to the common elements of successful start ups.<br><br>
			<h3>What do I get if I contribute?</h3>
			This is entirely an experiment. To my knowledge, no one has done this before. So let's dive into this together and see where it takes us and have some fun.
